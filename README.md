# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The new Horiseon website, which meets accessiblity standards and has semantic HTML elements.

- I switched out non-semantic HTML for semantic HTML including; header, section, aside, and footer.
- I updated the images to contain descriptive alt tags.
- Transformed certain classes into objects to eliminate repetitive code.
